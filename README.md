# cs50x-2025
## About
This is my practice repo for CS50x - 2025. Means, i will be following along the practices during the lecture and shorts, and trying to write the codes written during those sessions.

## Side notes
- Week 0 teaches how to work on Scratch where user have to build a little program using graphical interface, with the help of actual blocks of codes, just placing and moving them around, thus i don't have the week 0 in this repo.
